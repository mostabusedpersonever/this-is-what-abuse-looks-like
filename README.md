# Introduction

This page will publically (as a beginning) document what my lifelong abuse has looked like. To be recorded for all of eternity.

If you notice any of these signs. Contact me. Just create an issue or whatever and I will help you. You are not alone. There are people with empathy. A tiny tiny subset of people. Most don't unfortunately, especially women.

## Family

- They did not tell me the truth
- The never visited me
- They never talked to me
- They never raised me properly, as in, they completely ignored everything. They did not teach me anything.
- My mother has no idea what actually happened in my childhood or life
- My dad? I don't think ever talked to that guy more than one sentence in my life. When he talked, he yelled and abused me.

- Sister
- The sister who secretly undermines you
- Makes sure everyone abuses you
- Makes sure you don't get properly treated
- Brainwashes you into being docile (even though I have always been kind)
- Makes sure you know you are worthless
- Prevents you from finding a partner
- Prevents you from finding work
- Non-stop brainwashes you: Why buy a house? You're not worth it. Why have a girlfriend? Having a partner is not a good idea anyway. Why have kids? They are not worth it

## Friends

- No friends ever. Not one.
- They all have or had secret group chats
- They never talked to me
- Never invited me
- If they invited me, they never talked to me
- They never helped me
- They always made up excuses to not have time

## Women

- Treated me like an animal. Here, read this funny stuff.
- A "neurologist" woman from the Ukraine came to the date dressed up like she just woke up. Then tried to brainwash me into becoming a neurologist, said she wanted a house, a car and to live in SH. Stupid me was worried and tried to help her. Then she of course abused me further by chatting on the phone with her friend mid date and just disappearing
- Non-stop abuse by everyone
- My "girlfriends" all cheated on me, raped me, insulted me, lied to me. I have no idea who they were or what they were even called
- They even had body doubles.
- One, let us call her ObjectA. She had a body double and switched places nonstop, to rape me, and get her pregnant.
- No girlfriend ever

# General behavior

- Long stare! As intimidation and "secreto signal"
- Brainwashing and gaslighting. Oh no no no no no i NEVER SAID that. You send them an email, everyone just deletes it and ignores it. That is how the law works! You give them written proof. Oh, no. I can't read that. Oh, no. I can't open and view the image. Oh, no. We do not accept that kind of proof!


# Workplace

- Constant brainwashing
- Group mobbing and abuse, isolation
- No promotion ever
- No salary increase
- No compliments
- You work day and night. While they go to the cinema and lie in front of everyone, even HR.

# Leisure/Health

- Of course nobody has time for you. You want to learn the piano? Oh, sorry. Fully booked.
- You want to get an appointment at the hair dresser? Oh, sorry. Fully booked.
- You have brain damage? Oh, sorry. We do not treat brain damage here at the neuro center.

# Control

- The doctors talk behind your back (who cares about the Schweigepflicht)
- Your banks give out your bank account info secretly, breaking the "Bankgeheimnis"
- Other doctors just make up random shit and write anything in your report to further damage your reputation
- They always ask where you are going
- They always make sure that after they have found out where you were to remind you, to scare you, to control you

# Every day

- Always spend time alone, of course. Nobody ever calls you. Nobody ever texts you. Nobody ever says hello.
- You got to shops, especially the women refuse to look at you, serve you, treat you like a god damn normal human being. Why fire them, right?
- Constant random assaults and abuse, especially by women: random coughing at you, sneezing at you, you sit down, the women sit elsewhere, you look a them, they either look away or look at you in disgust

So as a response to this you can do:
- Contact me
- Go to the police (forget about it, there is no law)
- Or you contact me and we devise a plan for retaliation so your abusers will be terrorized daily for the rest of their lives
